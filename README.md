# Design patterns
This repo contains my implementations of some of the classic design patterns in Java.
Made for Software Engineering class at University of Parma, computer engineering dep.

As always, if you find this helpful drop me a line [here](https://t.me/kriive).

# Use
Import this maven project and run the desired example.

If you use IntelliJ Idea (I do), go to the desired pattern code (<name of the pattern>Main)
and click on the green "run" button, in the leftmost side of the code editor, right after the line code.
